This is a \"best effort\" service with limitations. There are no technical criteria when the specified caller ID name will be applied to a toll number.\n* The caller ID name applies to the entire organization or site. The admin cannot apply a different caller ID names for individual phone users.\n* Phone users can [hide their caller ID name and number](#h_122140f0-5172-495d-b1cc-52ee8caea7fe).\n\n![](https://assets.zoom.us/images/en-us/web/zoom-voice/company-info/caller-id-name.png)\n\nIn the US, the caller ID name that is displayed to the receiving party is determined by the phone service that is receiving the call, not the phone service where the call is originating. The phone service that is receiving the call relies on a caller ID name database to match the incoming caller ID number with a caller ID name. In the US, only the caller ID number is passed along to the receiving phone service so it's up to them to match the number with a caller ID name.\n\nNote that this may work differently depending on your country.\n\n"

Search your mail, including your spam or junk folder, for \"Pledgeling\" and see if that email rings a bell.\n\nAlso search for OnZoom events that you were invited to around the date of the charge. Click the link to the event's web page, and the Activity tab there may show donations, including yours.\n\nAlso *ask your spouse, partner, or family members if they made the charge* \u2013 if they did, they probably provided Pledgeling with their email address, so they should search for an email from Pledgeling right around the date of the charge.\n\nIf you still don't recognize the charge, submit a \"New Support Ticket\" [here](https://help.pledgeling.org/support/tickets/new) to ask Pledgeling to find out more about your donation. Please include:\n\n\n* The date of the charge as it appears on your card statement\n* The exact amount of the charge\n* The last four digits of the credit / debit card number on which the charge appears\n* Your first and last name\n* Any email addresses you might use when making an online donation\n\nUnfortunately, if you contact your credit card card company, that creates a \"dispute\" that Pledgeling's card processor charges Pledgeling $15 for. Pledgeling then has to deduct that $15 from the next monthly donation Pledgeling makes to the charitable organization associated with your donation, and *that comes out of other people's donations*. So *please get in touch with Pledgeling before disputing a charge through your bank or credit card company*.\n\n"

You should allow 24 to 72 hours for Zoom to make the change.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the phone service or carrier of the receiving party needs to update their caller ID name database for your new caller ID name to take effect. As a result, some people could see the new caller ID name while others see the old caller ID name. Since it costs money to update their caller ID name database, some carriers rarely update their databases so it could take weeks for your new caller ID name to take effect on all carriers. Generally, it can take around 3 weeks for the new caller ID name to be updated for external providers.\n\n"

Host can either allow only participants from specific counties/regions to join, or block all participants from specific counties/regions.\n\t+ **Enhancements to Outlook calendar integration**If MAPI is enabled, deleted meetings on the client and web will also delete the associated Outlook calendar event, as long as the event was not a web-scheduled recurring or PMI meeting. For On-Premise users, MAPI allows meeting change and deletion syncing.\n\t+ **View synced contacts in sub-folders**If users set up contacts integration and their contacts are organized into sub-folder in the third-party service (Outlook, Exchange, or Google), they can view those sub-folders in the contacts directory.\n\t+ **Rotate camera**Users on the desktop client for macOS can now rotate their camera video feed 90\u00b0. This can be done multiple times to completely flip the video, allowing for inverted cameras configurations.\n\t+ **Additional MSI/GPO options**\n\t\n\t\n\t\t- **Require new SSO login upon client start - DisableKeepSignedInWithSSO**Disabled by default, this option will prevent the client from utilizing the last SSO session info, requiring a fresh login for every re-opening of the client.\n\t\t- **Require new Google login upon client start - DisableKeepSignedInWithGoogle**Disabled by default, this option will prevent the client from utilizing the last Google session info, requiring a fresh login for every re-opening of the client.\n\t\t- **Require new SSO login upon client start** - **DisableKeepSignedInWithFacebook**Disabled by default, this option will prevent the client from utilizing the last Facebook session info, requiring a fresh login for every re-opening of the client.\n\t\t- **Set audio signal processing for Windows audio devices** - SetAudioSignalProcessType\n\t\tDefault value is Auto (0), but can also be set to Off (1)(raw audio mode) or On (2)(Windows default signal processing).\n\t\t- **Audio noise suppression** - SetSuppressBackgroundNoiseLevel\n\t\tDefault value is **Auto** (0), but can also be set to **Low** (1), **Medium** (2), or **High** (3). The **High** option requires an audio enhancement package (included in the MSI), and if not present,- the client will revert to **Auto**.\n* **Meeting/webinar features**\n\n\n\t+ **Share and play video files directly into meeting**The Video option under Advanced share options will allow you to choose a video file, which will be opened by Zoom and played in the meeting as shared content. Host has typical video player controls (pause/ play, volume control, full screen, video length/elapsed time), which are not seen by other participants during share. MP4 and MOV files are supported, and max video resolution is 1080p.\n\t+ **Blurred background**Users can now choose to blur their background rather than selecting a specific virtual background, providing added privacy when a branded background is unavailable or unnecessary.\n\t+ **Share mono or stereo sound**When sharing content and wanting to share computer sound as well, users can select between mono or stereo audio. Only the user sharing their audio will need to be utilizing this client version or higher.\n* **Meeting features**\n\n\n\t+ **Meeting reactions for End-to-End Encrypted meetings**Meeting reactions can now be utilized in E2EE meetings.\n\t+ **1:1 private chat for End-to-End Encrypted meetings**1:1 private chats can now be utilized in E2EE meetings, allowing for messages to all participants and private messages between 2 participants.\n* **Phone features**\n\n\n\t+ **SMS for international phone numbers**Users can send/receive SMS for certain countries/regions. Messages sent to international telephone numbers will be metered according to the international messaging rate table. This feature needs to be enabled by an admin.\n\t+ **Support for SMS and MMS messages in a single message bubble**Text (SMS) and images (MMS) can be shown in a single message bubble. Previously, text and images had to be in separate message bubbles.\n\t+ **Add contacts without specifying an email address**Users can add phone contacts by specifying a name and phone number. Previously, users had to use calendar integration to add contacts without an email address.\n\t+ **Additional ringtone**Users can set their ringtone to a beeping sound.\n\t+ **Voicemail notifications**Users will see a notification when they receive a new voicemail.\n\t+ **Group call pickup**Account owners and admins can use the web portal to create call pickup groups and add phone users as members. All groups members will see call notifications whenever there\u2019s an inbound call to a member. This feature is also supported on certain Yealink devices. This feature needs to be enabled by Zoom.\n* **Chat features**\n\n\n\t+ **Back to previous chat**The ability to return up to the previous chat channel or contact, as well as go forward. This allows you to respond to an urgent request or message, then quickly return to the channel you were previously working in without needing to search for it among others.\n\t+ **Request contact connections directly from chat channel**When creating a new channel or adding contacts to a channel, a contact request will be automatically sent if the associated email is not already an existing contact. Upon accepting the request, that contact will automatically be added to the channel. These pending requests can also be removed, and the requester will be notified when the request has been accepted.\n\n"

When a phone user signs in to the desktop client for the first time after you enable nomadic emergency services with bootstrap mode and personal locations, the desktop client will prompt the phone user to [enable location permission](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360052931771#h_01ESQ07J733XFFB44F36E1846H).\n2. When Zoom Phone detects a network change (IP or MAC address) that the user hasn't previously reported, Zoom Phone will prompt the user to confirm or update their emergency address:\n\n\n\t* **Desktop client**: If the network change is related to the desktop client, the phone user will [see the prompt directly in the desktop client](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360052931771#h_01ESQ53HZ0A6XMRDGC16GRW91A).\n\t* **Desk phone**: If the network change is related to a desk phone, the phone user will receive an email notification that will redirect them to their phone settings in the web portal.\n3. Zoom Phone will attempt to associate the phone user's network data with an existing company or personal location.\n\n\n\t* **Detectable location**: If the network data is associated with an existing location, the prompt will allow the phone user to confirm the detected emergency address, or update it. If the phone user confirm the address, they will be redirected to the web portal to select a location for this address. The address will be associated with the location.\n\t* **Undetectable location**: If the new network data is not associated with an existing location, the prompt will ask the phone user to add an emergency address.\n4. When updating or adding their emergency address, users will be able to:\n\n\n\t* Select a company location added to their site\n\t* Add a new emergency address as a company location\n\t* Select a saved personal location\n\t* Add a new emergency address as a personal location\n5. If the phone user does either of the first two options, you (and any specified email recipients) will receive an email notification to review and approve pending data for company locations. Sign in to the Zoom web portal to review and pending company location data. Once approved, the location will be automatically added as a company location.\n\n\n\n"

Messages sent to international telephone numbers will be metered according to the international messaging rate table.\n\t+ **Group call pickup**Account owners and admins can create call pickup groups and add phone users as members. All groups members will see call notifications whenever there\u2019s an inbound call to a member. This feature is supported on certain Yealink devices and client version 5.5.0 or higher (planned for release in February 2021). This feature needs to be enabled by Zoom.\n\t+ **Set the number of IVR prompt repeats for callers**Account owners and admins can set the number of times (1 to 3) the IVR prompt plays for callers that don\u2019t press an IVR menu option or press an invalid option. After the set number of repeats, the caller is routed based on overflow settings. Previously, IVR prompts always repeated 3 times.\n\t+ **Show direct phone number for internal calls from call queues and auto receptionists**Account owners and admins can enable a setting to show the direct phone number of internal inbound calls from call queues or auto receptionists. In other words, when a user dials an internal extension with an auto receptionist or call queue number as the caller ID, the receiver will see the selected outbound caller ID. This setting can be changed at the account level (multiple sites disabled) or site level (multiple sites enabled). If this setting is disabled, call notifications only show the extension number.\n\t+ **Search call queues by phone number**Account owners and admins can search through call queues by entering a phone number. Previously, they could only search by name or extension number\n\t+ **Enhancement to shared line group membership**If the account has enabled multiple sites, account owners and admins can add any phone user in the account to a site\u2019s shared line group. Previously, shared line groups could only contain members in the same site as the shared line group.\n\t+ **Total call time in usage report**Account owners and admins can view the total call time for each phone user.\n* **Devices**\n\n\n\t+ **[Desk phone companion mode](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360049007912)**Desk phone companion mode integrates Zoom meetings with your provisioned desk phone. This allows you to join a scheduled Zoom meeting and use your desk phone as the audio device; or receive a meeting invite and join the meeting using your desk phone as the audio device.\n\t+ **Supported devices**The AudioCodes C450HD (open SIP version) conference phone is supported. Account owners and admins can add this phone to the Zoom web portal as part of the provisioning process.\n\t+ **Support for call monitoring softkeys on Poly VVX devices**Most Poly VVX devices support call monitoring softkeys (listen, whisper, barge. And take over). Previously, phone users had to use key codes to use call monitoring features on VVX devices. Poly VVX devices must have firmware version 5.9.3.x or higher. This isn\u2019t supported on VVX 101, 201, and 150.\n\t+ **Secondary NTP server**Account owners and admins can specify a secondary NTP server for devices. The secondary NTP is used if the primary NTP server is not set, or can\u2019t be accessed.\n\t+ **Call park line key**Desk phone users can view and retrieve parked calls using a line key. The call park line key can be set up in the line key settings. Previously, users had to retrieve parked calls by manually dialing the retrieval code. This feature needs to be enabled by Zoom.\n\t+ **Support for Poly CCX series devices**Poly CCX series devices with UCS software version 7.0.0.4236 are supported. CCX series devices do not support these features:\n\t\n\t\n\t\t- Transfer to voicemail\n\t\t- Hot desking\n\t\t- Companion mode\n\t\t- Call monitoring\n\t+ **Increased character limit for line key alias**The alias for each line key can be up to 32 characters. Account owners, admins, and phone users can access line key settings to customize the alias for each line key.\n\n"

Account owners and admins can enable end to end encryption for meetings, providing additional protection when needed. Enabling end-to-end (E2E) encryption for meetings requires all meeting participants to join from the Zoom desktop client, mobile app, or Zoom Rooms. Users will not be able to join by telephone, SIP/H.323 devices, on-premise configurations, or Lync/Skype clients, as these endpoints cannot be encrypted end-to-end.

Enabling this setting also disables the following features: join before host, cloud recording, streaming, live transcription, Breakout Rooms, polling, and meeting reactions.

User-reported location and network data must be approved by administrators before it becomes actively part of defined company locations. These operations will send email notifications to admins (at most one email per day).\n\t+ **Call notifications for busy call queue members**If enabled, call queue members can receive call queue calls when they are busy on a call.\n\t+ **Opt out of specific call queues**Users who are members of multiple call queues can opt out of specific call queues to disable call notifications from those call queues.\n\n"

These changes are being made to prevent unwanted participants from joining your meeting or webinar.\n\nIf you do not already have passcodes set for your currently scheduled meetings or webinars before this change takes effect, we recommend deleting the existing meeting and scheduling a new meeting and re-sending the invite to your participants.\n\nManually entering a meeting/webinar ID will always prompt the user to enter the passcode. By default, Zoom embeds the passcode into meeting/webinar links, if participants click the link they will not be prompted to enter a passcode when joining. However, you can disable this setting at the account, group, or user level by turning off the setting\u00a0[Embed passcode in-meeting link for one-click join](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360033559832).\n\n"

If the screen goes black for longer than a minute, reboot the PC, it should continue the first time setup with no issues.\n\nWhen the installation process is complete, the Zoom Rooms interface will display with the [pairing code](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360000162383-Add-Zoom-Room-on-Controller) for the Zoom Rooms controller.\n\n**Administration**\n\n**To access the Windows Desktop**\n\n\n1. Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete.\n2. Click on the ZoomAdmin account and enter the default password of: zoom123\n\nOnce into the Windows Desktop all windows administrative options are available. We recommend changing the password for the ZoomAdmin account.\n\n**Note**: Do not exit Zoom via the Exit button. This will return a blank screen and the computer will need to be restarted. Starting with Zoom Rooms Version 4.1.5 (33237.0925) the Exit button will be replaced with Shutdown and Reboot buttons.\n\n**Returning to Zoom Rooms**\n\n\n1. To return back to Zoom Rooms from the Windows Desktop, restart the computer.\n2. Windows may warn that another user is signed in. This is expected and you can continue the restart.\n\n**Upgrading the Zoom Rooms application**\n\nIt is highly recommended to perform Zoom Rooms [upgrades and downgrades](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204675449-Upgrade-or-Downgrade-Zoom-Rooms-Software) via the Zoom admin portal rather than downloading and installing on the PC.\n\n"

There are two approaches to audio processing in a Zoom Room:\n\n\n1. Zoom's Software Audio Processing is enabled and the external mic and speaker are independent and unaware of each other.\n2. The DSP is external to Zoom and all processing and relationship between mic and speaker is completely external and Zoom's Software Audio Processing has been disabled.\n\nIf the input and output device are the same, such as a Logitech Rally System, Logitech Meetup, Aver VB342, Polycom Trio, or rack-mounted DSP, that device will handle all of the audio logic that is needed to have an optimal audio experience. Since Zoom is not handling the DSP in this instance, the [Software Audio Processing setting](#h_7de6e201-aae2-4d47-93fd-75426199063a) should be disabled.\n\nIt is important to note that certain devices have been developed to **automatically disable**Zoom SAP upon selection.
